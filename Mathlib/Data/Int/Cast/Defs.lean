# Cast of integers

This file defines the *canonical* homomorphism from the integers into an
additive group with a one (typically a `Ring`).  In additive groups with a one
element, there exists a unique such homomorphism and we store it in the
`intCast : ℤ → R` field.

Preferentially, the homomorphism is written as a coercion.

## Main declarations

* `Int.cast`: Canonical homomorphism `ℤ → R`.
* `AddGroupWithOne`: Type class for `Int.cast`.
