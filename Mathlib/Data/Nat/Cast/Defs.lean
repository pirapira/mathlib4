# Cast of natural numbers

This file defines the *canonical* homomorphism from the natural numbers into an
`AddMonoid` with a one.  In additive monoids with one, there exists a unique
such homomorphism and we store it in the `natCast : ℕ → R` field.

Preferentially, the homomorphism is written as the coercion `Nat.cast`.

## Main declarations

* `NatCast`: Type class for `Nat.cast`.
* `AddMonoidWithOne`: Type class for which `Nat.cast` is a canonical monoid homomorphism from `ℕ`.
* `Nat.cast`: Canonical homomorphism `ℕ → R`.

because they are recognized as terms of `R` (at least when `R` is an `AddMonoidWithOne`) through
`Zero` and `One`, respectively. -/
