/-- Recognize numeric literals which are at least `2` as terms of `R` via `Nat.cast`. This
instance is what makes things like `37 : R` type check.  Note that `0` and `1` are not needed
because they are recognized as terms of `R` (at least when `R` is an `AddMonoidWithOne`) through
`Zero` and `One`, respectively. -/
