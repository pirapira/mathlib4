### Classes of semirings and rings

We make sure that the canonical path from `NonAssocSemiring` to `Ring` passes through `Semiring`,
as this is a path which is followed all the time in linear algebra where the defining semilinear map
`σ : R →+* S` depends on the `NonAssocSemiring` structure of `R` and `S` while the module
definition depends on the `Semiring` structure.

It is not currently possible to adjust priorities by hand (see https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/2115). Instead, the last
declared instance is used, so we make sure that `Semiring` is declared after `NonAssocRing`, so
that `Semiring -> NonAssocSemiring` is tried before `NonAssocRing -> NonAssocSemiring`.
TODO: clean this once https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/2115 is fixed

/-- A `Semiring` is a type with addition, multiplication, a `0` and a `1` where addition is
commutative and associative, multiplication is associative and left and right distributive over
addition, and `0` and `1` are additive and multiplicative identities. -/
